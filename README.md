## 👋 So, who am I?

Hey! I'm **Srinidhi** — currently doing my Master's in Applied Data Intelligence at San José State University. I'm one of those people who gets genuinely excited about making things work better with code and data. Whether it's building software that scales, wrangling messy datasets into something useful, or training ML models that don't just look good on paper but actually solve problems, I'm in.

Lately, I've been kind of obsessed with **Agentic AI workflows**. You know, those systems where AI agents actually collaborate and get stuff done autonomously? I'm actively working on building and orchestrating these workflows — trying to push what's possible when you let intelligent agents work together. It's wild seeing them reason through problems and execute tasks that would normally need constant human oversight.

What drives me is pure curiosity, honestly. I can't help but tinker with new frameworks, read research papers at 2 AM (yes, really), and constantly ask "what if we did it differently?" I love the full spectrum — from writing clean production code to experimenting with bleeding-edge AI concepts.

**What I'm looking for:** Summer 2026 internships where I can actually build cool stuff. Specifically:
- **Software Engineering** — I want to write code that thousands (or millions) of people use
- **Data Science** — Turning messy data into clear insights is my jam
- **Machine Learning Engineering** — Building ML systems that work in production, not just notebooks
- **AI Engineering** — Especially anything involving agentic systems or next-gen AI applications

If you're building something interesting or just want to chat about tech, seriously, hit me up!

## 🚀 Stuff I've Built

Here's some work I'm actually proud of. Check out the repos if anything catches your eye (and maybe drop a ⭐ if you vibe with it):

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🎬 [Real-time YouTube Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/Mrnidhi)

Okay so this was fun — I built a complete serverless pipeline that pulls YouTube metrics, converts everything from JSON to Parquet (huge performance win), and pushes it all to dashboards that product teams can actually use.

**What it did:**
- Cut down manual data prep by 90% (nobody misses those spreadsheets)
- Made queries 5x faster with the Parquet optimization
- Got real-time KPIs into the hands of non-technical folks

**Stack:** AWS Lambda, Glue, Athena, S3, Apache Airflow, Spark/PySpark, Tableau, QuickSight

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🤖 [AI Customer Support Assistant](https://github.com/Mrnidhi)

Built this RAG-powered assistant that searches through 10k+ old support tickets to answer new questions. It's basically like having the entire support history at your fingertips, instantly.

**Results:**
- 95% answer accuracy (customers were impressed)
- 70% faster resolution times
- Sub-second responses with actual source citations

**Stack:** FastAPI, Next.js, Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, Google Gemini API

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🏗️ [Azure Medallion Data Pipeline](https://github.com/Mrnidhi)

This one was about doing data engineering properly. Implemented a full Bronze-Silver-Gold lakehouse architecture on Azure Databricks — the kind of thing that actually scales.

**Impact:**
- Pulled in 100k+ records from 8 different sources
- Made processing 60% faster
- Now powering analytics for over $2M in revenue decisions

**Stack:** Azure Databricks, Data Factory, Kafka, Power BI, Synapse

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🔒 [Sensitive Data Classifier](https://github.com/Mrnidhi)

Ever need to find sensitive info in images or docs? Built a CNN + OCR system that does exactly that — super useful for data governance teams.

**Numbers:**
- 98% F1 score for detecting sensitive data
- Drag-and-drop web interface (no technical skills needed)
- 4-layer CNN with ~6.7M parameters

**Stack:** TensorFlow.js, Python, Tesseract OCR

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔄 [Multi-Agent AI Platform](https://github.com/Mrnidhi)

This is where things get interesting. I experimented with AI agents that actually collaborate — they designed, coded, and deployed a trading simulation together. Watching them work is honestly pretty cool.

**What happened:**
- Cut the dev cycle by 60%
- Got 95% test coverage across 25+ edge cases
- Basically automated the whole development process

**Stack:** CrewAI, Python, Gradio, PyTest

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ✈️ [Aviation Visibility Predictor](https://github.com/Mrnidhi)

Built this for aviation safety — predicts low-visibility events using weather data. Added custom meteorological features because standard ones weren't cutting it.

**Performance:**
- 45% better RMSE than baseline models
- Real-time API with uncertainty estimates
- Containerized for easy deployment

**Stack:** scikit-learn, Flask, Docker, Python

</td>

## 💼 Where I've Worked

### 🔬 Data Scientist @ WebNet Solutions | *May - Nov 2024*

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS%20SageMaker-84%25%20Precision-success?style=flat-square&logo=amazonaws" alt="SageMaker" />
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ETL-25k%2B%20Records%2Fday-blue?style=flat-square&logo=apacheairflow" alt="ETL" />
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Performance-50%25%20Faster-orange?style=flat-square&logo=amazonredshift" alt="Optimization" />
</p>

So here's what I did at WebNet:

- Built and deployed an **XGBoost churn model** on AWS SageMaker that hit 84% precision. This actually helped cut customer attrition by 12% and bumped renewals by 15%. Seeing it work in production was rewarding.
  
- Created **serverless ETL pipelines** with Lambda, Glue, and Airflow processing 25k+ records every single day. Improved data quality by 30% — turns out clean pipelines = clean data (who knew? 😄).

- Spent time **optimizing our Redshift warehouse** — played around with schemas and partitions until we got queries running 50% faster and slashed storage costs by 30%.

### 🔬 Data Science Intern @ WebNet Solutions | *Dec 2023 - May 2024*

My first real taste of production data work:

- **Built various ML models** (supervised and unsupervised) that beat our baseline by 18%. Learned a ton about what actually works vs. what just looks good in theory.

- **Engineered pipelines** for multi-million-row datasets — got preprocessing time down by 35%. Turns out optimization matters when you're dealing with that much data.

- **Did a lot of EDA** which actually improved our feature engineering by 20%. Good old exploratory analysis never goes out of style.

## 💡 What I'm Exploring Right Now

So here's what's keeping me up at night (in a good way):

- 🤖 **Agentic AI workflows** — Actively building systems where AI agents actually collaborate and get stuff done autonomously. It's fascinating watching them reason through complex problems.

- 🔮 **Multi-agent orchestration** — Figuring out how to make multiple AI agents work together smoothly. Like a really smart team that never sleeps.

- 🔍 **Advanced RAG** — Going way beyond basic retrieval. Hybrid search, re-ranking, the works. Making AI that actually understands context.

- ⚡ **Real-time data streaming** — Building pipelines with Kafka and Flink that handle data as it comes in, not hours later.

- 🔒 **Privacy-preserving ML** — Because training models on sensitive data shouldn't mean exposing that data. Still figuring this one out but it's important.

- 🏗️ **System design at scale** — Learning how to build distributed systems that don't fall apart when things get big.

- 🧠 **LLM fine-tuning** — Making large language models actually useful for specific tasks, not just general chatbots.

- 📚 **Reading everything** — Research papers, tech blogs, docs, you name it. If it's about AI, data, or software engineering, I'm probably reading it.

## 📝 Random Things About Me

- 🔍 I genuinely read research papers for fun. Yeah, I know how that sounds. But there's something satisfying about understanding how things work at a fundamental level.

- 🤖 Kind of obsessed with Agentic AI right now. Building systems where AI agents work together autonomously feels like we're living in the future.

- 🔮 I really believe we're at the start of something huge with AI. Want to be someone who builds it, not just talks about it.

- 🎯 Here's a hill I'll die on: good data engineering is like 80% of what makes ML projects succeed. Clean pipelines > fancy algorithms.

- 🚀 If I have to do something manually more than twice, I'm writing a script for it. Or lately, building an agent to do it.

- 💡 Always have 3-4 side experiments running. Currently it's multi-agent systems and advanced RAG architectures.

- 📊 Guilty pleasure: spending way too long making the perfect data visualization. Color schemes matter, okay?

- 🌱 Learn something new every day philosophy. This week it's prompt engineering techniques. Last week was Kafka optimization.

- ☕ Run on coffee and curiosity. Mostly curiosity about *why* things work the way they do.

- 🛠️ I like both sides — building rock-solid production code AND experimenting with wild, experimental ideas. Why choose?
